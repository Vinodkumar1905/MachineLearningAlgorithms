# ML Regression Project
This is my small machine learning project where I tried out regression techniques.
I tried writing My own Gradient Descent algo and its went pretty well 
I even tried decaying rate for alfa but that code isnt posted yet there is some tuming left to make it 
fully functionable once done it will be posted
I used Python and Jupyter Notebook to play around with data and see how models predict stuff.  

What I did
- Loaded some data  
- Tried linear regression and maybe some other regression models  
- Checked how well the predictions work  
- Learned a lot about how regression works in real life  

## How to run
1. Make sure you have Python installed (I used 3.x)  
2. Install the necessary packages: like numpy and pandas
3. sklearn for r^2 comparison  our code dont have in built function for this purpose
